/* Strings */
// JS allows you to use single quotes or double quotes to define a string.
//Traditionally, other languages restrict you to double quotes, so it can be wise to use double quotes, for convention and easy switching between languages.

/* Operators */
/* Like any programming language, Javascript has operator precedence. Some operators are treated as more important than others. BEDMAS, I believe. */
// You can make sure certain operations are done first by surrounding them with parentheses (i.e., brackets). */
/*
/ B -- Brackets
/ E -- Exponents
/ D -- Division
/ M -- Multiplication
/ A -- Addition
/ S -- Subtraction
